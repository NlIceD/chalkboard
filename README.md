Football event data capture and illustration using R/Shiny

This repository hosts the R/Shiny code for my [Chalkboard football app](apps.hilltop-analytics.com/chalkboard).

I'm making it available for customisation, improvements, re-purposing into other sports and anything else you can think of!

You can find me on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/neilcharles_uk).
